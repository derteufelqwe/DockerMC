1. Why a shaded version?
BungeeCord uses Guava version 21 and IBMs etcd-java uses Guava 28.2. Since BungeeCord only loads this plugin only Guava
21 is available at runtime. This obviously causes errors

2. Solution
Recompile etcd-java and shaded guava 28.2. This renames it so there are two versions of Guava but with different names

3. Create patched version
Clone https://github.com/IBM/etcd-java, add the content of plugin.xml to the build/plugins section and package the project.
Note: You might need to remove the "-SNAPSHOT"-part of the version tag

4. Install version
Replace {version} with the version and execute the following maven command:
install:install-file -Dfile=./target/etcd-{version}-shaded.jar -DgroupId=com.ibm.etcd -DartifactId=etcd-java -Dversion={version}-shaded -Dpackaging=jar -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DpomFile=pom.xml

5. Use dependency
Set the version of the dependency to {version}-shaded when including the patched jar
